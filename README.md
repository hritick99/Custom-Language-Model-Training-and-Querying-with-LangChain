# Custom Language Model Training and Querying with LangChain

## Overview

This repository contains code for training a custom language model (LLM) using LangChain, a library for natural language processing tasks. The trained model is capable of answering questions based on a given dataset of prompts and corresponding responses. Additionally, the code includes functionality for speech recognition, allowing users to input queries via microphone.

## Features

- Train a custom language model on a dataset of prompts and responses.
- Perform question-answering tasks using the trained model.
- Input queries via microphone using speech recognition.
- Easily deploy the code by following the provided deployment steps.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your_username/your_repository.git
    ```

2. Install the required dependencies:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Deployment Steps

1. Download the Python file (`your_script.py`) and the dataset CSV file (`prompt_dataset.csv`).
2. Change the location of the dataset in the Python file to match the directory where you saved `prompt_dataset.csv`.
3. Optionally, add more data to the dataset CSV file by editing it with additional prompts and responses.

## Usage

1. Run the Python script (`your_script.py`) using your preferred Python interpreter.
2. Follow the on-screen instructions to input queries via speech or manually.
